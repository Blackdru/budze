**Solution**:
- Added Platform detection for proper URL selection
- Improved development vs production environment handling
- Fixed API URL consistency across different platforms

**Files Modified**:
- `src/config/config.js`

### 5. **Navigation and Back Button Issues** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Inconsistent back button behavior across screens.

**Solution**:
- Added proper back button handling in MatchmakingScreen

- Improved network error handling

### 8. **Payment Flow Improvements** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Incomplete payment verification and error handling.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive payment error handling
- Implemented proper payment cancellation handling
- Added network error detection for payments
- Improved user feedback for payment status

## Code Quality Improvements

### 9. **API Request Standardization** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Created reusable API utility functions
- Implemented consistent timeout handling
- Added request retry mechanism
- Standardized response validation

### 10. **Error Boundary Implementation** ✅ IMPROVED
- Better error catching and handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Proper error logging for debugging

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist:

   - [ ] Verify balance update after successful payment

2. **Matchmaking Flow**:
   - [ ] Test socket connection and disconnection
   - [ ] Test back button behavior
   - [ ] Test auto-timeout functionality
   - [ ] Verify memory cleanup

3. **Authentication Flow**:
   - [ ] Test OTP sending with network errors
   - [ ] Test OTP verification with various scenarios
   - [ ] Verify token storage and retrieval

4. **Navigation Flow**:
   - [ ] Test back button on all screens
   - [ ] Verify proper navigation stack management
   - [ ] Test Android hardware back button

## Performance Improvements

### Memory Management:
- Fixed timer and interval cleanup
- Proper socket connection management
- Reduced memory leaks in long-running screens

### Network Optimization:
- Added request timeouts to prevent hanging
- Implemented retry mechanism for failed requests
